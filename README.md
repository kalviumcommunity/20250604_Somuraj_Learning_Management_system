# 🚀 LearnNest – A Learning Management System

Welcome to **LearnNest**, a lightweight, modern Learning Management System (LMS) built with **React.js**, **Clerk authentication**, and a clean, responsive UI. Designed with simplicity and scalability in mind, LearnNest enables students, professionals, and independent educators to learn and teach skill-based content in a fast, elegant frontend-only platform.

## ❓ Problem Statement

In a world where digital learning is booming, many LMS platforms are bulky, backend-heavy, or over-engineered for solo creators and learners. They often require unnecessary server-side logic or CMS integration, making them hard to customize or deploy for small use cases.

**LearnNest** solves this by offering a focused, no-clutter LMS that’s entirely frontend-powered — yet ready to scale. It uses modern tools like **Clerk** for secure authentication and **React** for a component-based UI. This project proves that a fully functional LMS doesn’t need a backend to get started!
